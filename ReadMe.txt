This plugin is 32 bit only and only works with the 32 bit version of Total Commander.
As there are better ways to access the filesystem on Android devices I also don't plan
on updating it any further, but if you'd like you can try compiling it with th 64 bit
version of visual studio.

The easiest way to access a modern Android phone through Total Commander is to
select "Computer" from the drive dropdown, and then you'll see your device similarly
to how you'd see it if you'd opened "Computer" from Windows Explorer. TCMD will use
the Windows Explorer APIs to communicate with your device, which is usually fine.
